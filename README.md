COMTRADE file converter written in F#.

"C37.111-1999 - IEEE Standard Common Format for Transient Data Exchange (COMTRADE) for Power Systems".

Initially F# has been choosen mostly for learning purposes but it turned out that this language is really useful (elegant, succinct, with many powerfull features) for cases where quite complex but well structured (well defined) ASCII file must be converted into an object.
